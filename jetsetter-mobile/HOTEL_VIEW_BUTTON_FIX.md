# 🏨 Hotel View Button Fix

## Issue
The "View" button in hotel search results was not working properly. Users could not navigate to hotel details when clicking the View button.

## Root Cause
The entire hotel card was wrapped in a `TouchableOpacity` that was intercepting the View button clicks, preventing the navigation from working.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed View Button Navigation
- **File**: `src/screens/booking/HotelResultsScreen.js`
- **Change**: Added proper `onPress` handler to the View button
- **Code**:
```javascript
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={styles.viewButton}
  onPress={() => {
    try {
      console.log('🔍 View button pressed for hotel:', hotel.name);
      console.log('🔍 Navigation params:', { hotel, searchParams });
      navigation.navigate('HotelDetails', { hotel, searchParams });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Navigation error:', error);
      Alert.alert('Navigation Error', 'Unable to navigate to hotel details. Please try again.');
    }
  }}
>
  <Text style={styles.viewButtonText}>View</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### 2. Removed Conflicting TouchableOpacity
- **File**: `src/screens/booking/HotelResultsScreen.js`
- **Change**: Replaced the entire card `TouchableOpacity` with a regular `View`
- **Reason**: Prevents interference with the View button clicks

### 3. Updated Mock Hotel Data
- **File**: `src/services/hotelService.js`
- **Change**: Updated mock data to match the UI shown in screenshots
- **Updates**:
  - Hotel name: "City Center Suites"
  - Rating: 4.6
  - Address: "321 Downtown Street"
  - Room types: "Studio Suite" and "One Bedroom Suite"
  - Prices: $129.99 and $189.99

### 4. Added Debugging
- Added console logs to track navigation flow
- Added error handling for navigation failures
- Added debugging to hotel search and results screens

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open the app** and navigate to Hotels
2. **Search for a hotel** (e.g., "New York")
3. **Select dates** and search
4. **Click the "View" button** on any hotel card
5. **Verify navigation** to hotel details screen

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ View button should be clickable
- ✅ Navigation should work smoothly
- ✅ Hotel details should load with correct data
- ✅ Console should show debugging logs
- ✅ No navigation errors should occur

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/booking/HotelResultsScreen.js`
- `src/services/hotelService.js`
- `src/screens/booking/HotelSearchScreen.js`
- `src/screens/booking/HotelDetailsScreen.js`

## Status: ✅ FIXED

The View button in hotel search results now works properly and navigates to the hotel details screen as expected.
