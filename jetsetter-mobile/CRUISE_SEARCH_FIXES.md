# 🚢 Cruise Search Fixes - Testing Guide

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Search Validation**
- **Problem**: Required at least one search criteria (destination, departure port, or cruise line)
- **Fix**: Removed strict validation to allow showing all cruises when no criteria provided
- **Result**: Users can now search with any combination of criteria or no criteria

### 2. **Date Picker Debugging**
- **Problem**: Date picker might not be working properly
- **Fix**: Added console logging to track date picker events
- **Result**: Better visibility into date selection process

### 3. **Search Process Debugging**
- **Problem**: Search process wasn't providing enough feedback
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive console logging throughout search process
- **Result**: Clear visibility into search parameters and results

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Search returns no results
- **Check**: Console logs for search parameters
